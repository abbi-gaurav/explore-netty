* Core components
* Channel
- *Socket*
- a vehicle for incoming and outgoing data
- Every Channel has an associated ChannelPipeline, which holds a chain of ChannelHandler instances.
- it is associated with a single eventloop for its lifetime
* ChannelFuture
- Asynchronous notification
- Each of Nettyâ€™s outbound I/O operations returns a ChannelFuture; that is, none of them block. 
* EventLoop
- Control Flow
- Multithreading
- Concurrency
- one eventloop is bound to a single thread
* Events and Handlers
- ChannelHandler  : handle various events
  - default handler implementations in the form of *adapter* classes,
- ChannelPipeline : container for a chain of event handlers
  - Ordered arrangement of ChannelHandlers
